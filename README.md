🚗 Car Showroom Management System – Python

The Car Showroom Management System is a console-based Python application created
to simulate the basic operations of a car showroom. This project allows users
to manage car inventory, sell cars, and view available cars using a simple
menu-driven interface.

This project was developed as an early learning project and focuses on
understanding how Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts can be applied
to real-world problems using Python.

The idea behind this project comes from real car showrooms, where vehicles are
added to inventory, sold to customers, and displayed based on availability.
This application replicates those operations in a simplified way.

The application runs through a command-line interface where users are presented
with options such as adding a new car, selling a car, displaying available
inventory, or exiting the program.

Each car in the showroom is represented as an object with properties such as
make, model, year, price, and availability status. This helps in understanding
how real-world entities can be modeled using classes in Python.

The showroom itself is managed using a separate class that handles all car
inventory operations. This separation of responsibilities makes the code clean
and well-structured.

Overall, this project demonstrates how Python classes, objects, and methods
work together to build a complete and functional application.

The Car Showroom project is a strong foundation-level project that helped build
confidence in Python programming and object-oriented design.

🛠️ Technologies Used

This project is developed using Python, which is used to implement the core
application logic and user interaction.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as classes and objects are
used to model cars and the showroom system.

Lists are used to store and manage the car inventory.

Loops and Conditional Statements are used to repeatedly display the menu
and process user choices.

📂 How the Code Works (Step-by-Step)

The program starts by creating a showroom object that manages the inventory.

Some initial car objects are added to the showroom to simulate existing stock.

A menu is displayed to the user with options such as adding a car, selling a
car, displaying inventory, or exiting the program.

When the user selects the option to add a car, the program collects car details
such as make, model, year, and price, and adds the car to the inventory.

When selling a car, the program searches the inventory for a matching car that
is available. If found, the availability status is updated.

The display inventory option lists all cars that are currently available in the
showroom.

This process continues in a loop until the user chooses to exit the program.

▶️ How to Run the Project

🎯 What I Learned

This project helped me understand the fundamentals of Object-Oriented
Programming in Python.

I learned how to create and use classes, objects, constructors, and methods to
model real-world entities.

I improved my understanding of how to manage data using lists and how to update
object attributes dynamically.

This project strengthened my logical thinking and helped me understand how to
structure larger Python programs.

As my first project, it played an important role in building my confidence in
Python development.

🚀 Future Enhancements

Add file handling to store showroom data permanently
Implement search and filter options
Add customer details and billing system
Improve input validation and error handling
Create a graphical user interface (GUI)
Integrate database support for inventory management
